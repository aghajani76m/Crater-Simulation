# Crater-Simulation
Simulation the shape of a crater created by impact of a meteroite
In this project have been tried to simulate the shape of the crater that is created by the impact of the earth using scientific calculations and approximations.
This program is implemented in such a way that the user can enter the desired values as input for the projectile diameter, speed, density and even the type of surface it strikes (sea or non-sea) and view the output. So this program is interactive and this inteactivity causes variety and beauty of outputs and of course high complexity of calculation and simulation.
Hope you enjoy!
